## What do you want to present?

Title: Transforming the Tree - AST Manipulation in Scripts


Abstract:
In recent years a lot of great tools have been developed for programmatic manipulation of low level programs.
This talk instead brings the focus to script languages such as Javascript, PHP, Powershell and VBA.
These languages are still used for malware and often undergo various forms of obfuscation.
Multiple techniques exist for deobfuscation but methods are often ad-hoc and language specific.
I present how manipulating the script code at an AST level and bringing into a unified "meta-language" can leverage theories about graphs and computing to provide a solid foundation on which powerful deobfuscation techniques and other forms of manipulation can be developed.
Parallels can be drawn to LLVM and similar constructs and how they have changed the way we view and work with low level programs.

Bio:
Carl Svensson is a security professional and enthusiast. He holds a master's degree in computer science from the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) following a life-long interest for computers and IT.
He currently works as the Head of Security at the Swedish healthcare startup KRY which he joined after some time as a security consultant.
He's a frequent CTF player, both solo and as a member of  HackingForSoju, one of the top ranked CTF teams in the world. This puts him against a wide range of challenges and have helped rapidly expand his knowledge despite only a few years in the security field.


Demonstration: Not really, just input, output, results from the tools demonstrated
Audience participation: hope fully someone dares to ask a question this time ;)
Length: I prefer a focused 15-20 mins talk, but can be extended if so desired to add more background and context.
No additional equipment needed.
