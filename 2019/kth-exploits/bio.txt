Title: An introduction to binary exploitation

Abstract:
As programmers we have been taught that writing outside a buffer or overflowing an integer can lead to security issues.
Why is this so? Exactly how does something, possibly as small as one byte, cause such big problems?
This talks aims to give an introduction to binary exploitation, i.e. the science (and art) of utilising bugs in low-level systems to cause unintended behviour and possibly a full compromise of the system.
Starting with basic exploitation techniques from the nineties working our way all the way to modern exploitation techniques, the goal is to give the listeners an understanding of some of these techniques and hopefully a little bit of inspiration to start trying them out yourself.
