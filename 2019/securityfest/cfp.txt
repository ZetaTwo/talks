# What do you want to present?
- Title: Software obfuscation with LLVM
- Abstract: Software obfuscation is a method to make programs more difficult to reverse engineer. There are multiple reasons why this is done such as protecting intellectual property, defense in depth or hiding bugs. No matter the reason, there are multiple ways to go about in making the software more difficult to understand, from fully manual modifications to advanced commercial obfuscation frameworks. This talks gives a short intro to software obfuscation and shows how to take advantage of the popular and extremely powerful compiler framework, LLVM, to create automated obfuscation tools for your code.
