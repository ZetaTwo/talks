He is a frequent CTF player for the Swedish top team HackingForSoju and an active member of the Swedish and international security community with a great fondness for a broad range of topics, reverse engineering being one of his favorites.
3. Fun with symbolic execution: exploit development and deobfuscation. In this lightning talk I will demonstrate how to use symbolic execution of machine code to accomplish two different things. First I will show how to go from a bug to a properly exploitable vulnerability and guide the exploitation process. Secondly I will show how symbolic execution can be used to automatically deobfuscate low level obfuscation in binaries making them easier to reverse engineer.
4. The talk will give a short background to symbolic execution, both conceptually and concretely in the form of presenting "angr". I will then show how symbolic execution can help discover how a specific bug can be triggered and turned into an exploit. Finally I will show how symbolic execution can help in deobfuscation by removing dead code and jump target obfuscation.
